# NET302-R | Ask me anything about networking

This chalk talk covers the breadth of AWS networking services. Are you facing challenges figuring out how you can optimize Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), where Amazon VPC Lattice fits in to your architecture, how you can migrate to AWS PrivateLink, how you should implement AWS Verified Access, whether you should migrate from AWS Transit Gateway to AWS Cloud WAN, or any other networking topic? Bring your questions to explore in detail through interactive conversations and whiteboarding.
